Contrary to what is sugggested in the OpenNeuroDatasets, there is nothing in the OpenNeuroDatasets Github page (see: https://github.com/OpenNeuroDatasets/ds002425.git ) which is indicated on the OpenNeuro (see: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002425/versions/1.0.2). \ 

This means that `datalad install can't find anything besides the directory root name. \

Avoidant solution: download the data with the bash script found on the datasets openneuro page (in the download window). 

Progress: Apparently this was just an OpenNeuro Bug. Raising an issue on openneurio.org/openneuro github would have been useful. Chris M is on it. But that's gonna take time.
